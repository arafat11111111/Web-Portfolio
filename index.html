            <p>It seems like there might be a typo in your question. If you meant to ask about web development, I'd be
                happy to help! Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications.
                It involves a combination of front-end development (the client-side or user interface) and back-end
                development (the server-side or server logic).</p>
